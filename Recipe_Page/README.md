## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned more about formatting and creating a webpage. I learned about fonts, custom fonts, and using local fonts.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue to grow my abilities, and get my page proportions more similar to the examples.

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla Dev @Font-Face](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/@font-face) - This page helped me understand how to include local fonts better.

- [Mozilla Dev Font-Family](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-family) - This helped me understand more about font, and font-family, in general.
